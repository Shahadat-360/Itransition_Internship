# Dynamic Topics Implementation

This feature allows users to create and manage custom topics for organizing their form templates instead of using a fixed set of predefined topics.

## Features Added

1. **Topic Model**
   - Created a new `Topic` entity with properties:
     - Id
     - Name
     - Description
     - CreatedAt
     - FormTemplates (navigation property)

2. **Updated FormTemplate Model**
   - Changed `Topic` from a string to a navigation property
   - Added `TopicId` as a foreign key
   - Added backward compatibility for the old `Topic` property

3. **Topic Controller and Views**
   - Created a full CRUD controller for topics
   - Implemented views for listing, creating, editing, and deleting topics
   - Implemented popup support for adding topics directly from template forms

4. **Updated Template Views**
   - Changed the topic dropdown to use dynamic topics from the database
   - Added a "New Topic" button that opens a popup to create a new topic
   - Implemented AJAX refresh to update the topics dropdown after creating a new topic

5. **Seeded Default Topics**
   - Added code to seed 10 default topics in the database

## Steps to Complete Implementation

1. **Create Database Migration**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add AddTopicsEntity
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

2. **Verify and Fix Any Warnings**
   - Update any controllers that still use the old `Topic` string property
   - Make sure all views use `TopicId` and the dropdown with dynamic topics

3. **Test the Implementation**
   - Create a new topic
   - Create a form template with the new topic
   - Edit an existing template to change its topic
   - Delete a topic that's not used by any templates
   - Verify that you can't delete topics that are in use

## Important Files Changed

- `FormsApp/Models/Topic.cs` (new file)
- `FormsApp/Models/FormTemplate.cs`

- `FormsApp/Views/FormTemplate/Create.cshtml`

## Important Notes

- The system is designed to maintain backward compatibility with existing templates
- The Topic class has a relationship with FormTemplate where deleting a Topic is prevented if it's in use
- The dropdown for selecting topics includes a convenient way to add new topics without leaving the form
